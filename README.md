# DIGITAL-ATTENDANCE
This project is a console-based digital attendance system developed using C++. It is designed to replace the traditional paper-based attendance system used in lecture halls. The system allows lecturers to register students, create lecture sessions, mark attendance, and generate attendance reports.
